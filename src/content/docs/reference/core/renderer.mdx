title: Renderer
description: angular-three Renderer API
---

The custom renderer powers the entire Angular Three and is provided via a dedicated platform entry point.

- [`angular-three/dom`](./dom/introduction) for DOM/Browser platform

```angular-ts
import { provideNgtRenderer } from 'angular-three/dom';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideNgtRenderer()]
});
```

## Catalogue

Angular Three maintains a **single catalogue** of THREE.js objects to render. By default, the catalogue is empty.

### `extend`

In order to populate the catalogue, you can call the `extend()` function and pass in a `Record` of THREE.js objects. Angular Three then maps the catalogue to **Custom Element** tags with the following naming convention:

```angular-ts
import { extend } from 'angular-three';
import { Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial, LOD, Object3D } from 'three';

extend({
    Mesh, // makes ngt-mesh available
    MeshBasicMaterial, // makes ngt-mesh-basic-material available
    LOD, // makes ngt-lOD available
    Object3D, // makes ngt-object3D
    MyMesh: Mesh, // makes ngt-my-mesh available
});
```

#### Overrides

`extend()` can be called multiple times and the later invocation will merge the `Record` with the existing catalogue. This is useful for when you want to provide a different implementation for a specific **Custom Element** tag like switching between `WebGPURenderer` and `WebGLRenderer`

```angular-ts
import { extend } from 'angular-three';
import { DirectionalLight  } from 'three';
import { DirectionalLight as WebGPUDirectionalLight } from 'three/webgpu';

extend({ DirectionalLight }); // make ngt-directional-light available
extend({ DirectionalLight: WebGPUDirectionalLight }); // after this, ngt-directional-light will now instantiate the WebGPU DirectionalLight instead
```

:::note

`extend()` should be called **before rendering** takes place like outside of the class body or in the `constructor`

:::

### `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`

Since Angular Three works with **Custom Element** tags, you need to have `schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]` in your component's metadata.

:::tip

`CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` is only needed if you actually render `ngt-*` elements on the component's template. This only affects the compiler, not the runtime.

```angular-ts
@Component({
    selector: 'app-box',
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh>
            <ngt-box-geometry />
        </ngt-mesh>
    `,
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
})
export class Box {}

@Component({
    template: `
        <app-box />
    `,
    imports: [Box]
})
export class SceneGraph {}
```

:::

## Property Bindings

You can bind values to any `ngt-*` elements using [**Property Binding**](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/6-property-binding) syntax.

```angular-html {2,6}
<ngt-mesh
    [position]="[1, 2, 3]"
>
    <ngt-box-geometry />
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material
        color="red"
    />
</ngt-mesh>
```

### Shortcuts

Some THREE.js objects have different methods to update their values due to performance and how WebGL works. For example, `THREE.Vector3` has a `set` method that accepts a tuple of `[x, y, z]` instead. On the other hand, if we pass in a `THREE.Vector3` instance, the current `THREE.Vector3` will call `copy` and pass in the new instance instead.

This characteristic is baked into the custom renderer so it is more intuitive to pass values to these properties.

```angular-html {"accept a tuple": 2-3} {"accept a scalar": 4-5} {"accept an instance": 6-7}
<ngt-mesh

  [position]="[0, 1, 0]"

  [scale]="1.5"

  [rotation]="myRotation"
/>
```

#### `ColorRepresentation`

Any elements that accept a color property can accept a `ColorRepresentation` type

```angular-html {"accept a css color": 2-3} {"accept a hex color": 5-6} {"accept a rgb color": 8-9} {"accept a color instance": 11-12} {"accept a hex color": 14-15}
<!-- different ways to pass in color -->

<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="hotpink" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="#ff00ff" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="rgb(255, 0, 255)" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material [color]="myColor" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material [color]="myHexadecimalColor" />
```

### Coercion

Angular Three custom renderer automatically coerces primitive values.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh
    castShadow
    receiveShadow
/>
```

:::tip

Although primitive values are coerced but the recommendation is to only rely on coercion for `boolean` values for consistency and correctness

```angular-html
<ngt-spot-light
    castShadow
    [decay]="0"
/>
```

Technically, `decay="0"` works but it is not necessarily shorter than `[decay]="0"` but `castShadow` is substantially more concise than `[castShadow]="true"`

:::

### Pierced Properties

Angular Three supports **pierced properties** via dot-notation. Imagine you want to turn a plane (`THREE.Mesh` with `THREE.PlaneGeometry`) on its side to make the plane into a floor, instead of passing `[rotation]="[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]"` to the `<ngt-mesh>`, you can pierce the rotation property with `[rotation.x]="-Math.PI / 2"`.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh [position.y]="-0.5" [rotation.x]="-Math.PI / 2">
    <ngt-plane-geometry />
</ngt-mesh>
```

#### Pierced properties trade-offs

There are trade-offs worth noting for piercing properties.

The pro is it works extremely well for component-based frameworks like Angular where underlying operations use some sort of change detection strategy to determine whether to update the template or not. Since pierced properties allow us to work with more primitive values on the template, it is easier for the change detection mechanism to work with.

However, when it comes to piercing properties of a non-builtin object like an external `THREE.Material` that you bind to a `<ngt-mesh>` via `[material]`, timing of property bindings might get weird and things might not work the way you expect it to. For cases like this, it is recommended to use [`ngt-value`](./raw-value) instead.

Considering the following example

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh [material]="gltf.materials.material" material.color="green" />
<!-- vs -->
<ngt-mesh [material]="gltf.materials.material" [material.color]="'green'">
```

These 2 snippets behave differently in terms of timing. The first snippet will update the **original material** first then bind a new material later; while the second snippet will bind correctly but the order matters. It gets trickier when it comes to more complex objects like textures.

Hence, pierce properties are **only recommended** for built-in properties of a THREE.js object that are **less likely** to change like `position`, `rotation`, `scale` etc...

### Angular Three Properties

Beside the properties of the native THREE.js objects, there are some special properties that are specific to Angular Three.

#### `parameters`

All custom elements accept a `parameters` property that accepts an object of properties to pass to the underlying object.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh-basic-material
    [parameters]="{ color: 'hotpink', side: BackSide, transparent: true }"
/>
```

Shortcuts are still applied with `parameters`

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh
    [parameters]="{
        position: [1, 2, 3],
        scale: 1.5,
        rotation: myRotation
    }"
/>
```

#### `attach`

This property is used to specify a property on the parent that this element should be attached to. Attaching takes into account the life-cycle of the elements and will automatically detach when the elements are destroyed.

##### Static Attach

If you want to bind a static value to `attach`, use **Attribute Binding** to bind a static string to it

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh>
    <ngt-box-geometry attach="geometry" />
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material attach="material" />
</ngt-mesh>
```

<details>
<summary>THREE.js equivalent</summary>

```angular-ts
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

mesh.material = material;
mesh.geometry = geometry;
```

</details>

:::tip

For convenience, Angular Three automatically assigns `attach=geometry` on all Geometries and `attach=material` on all Materials.

:::

##### Nested Path Attach

You can attach to a deeply nested property on the parent by using dot-separated path

```angular-html
<ngt-spot-light castShadow>
    <ngt-vector2 attach="shadow.mapSize" />
</ngt-spot-light>
```

<details>
<summary>THREE.js equivalent</summary>

```angular-ts
const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight();
spotLight.castShadow = true;

const vector2 = new THREE.Vector2();
// shortcut is still applied automatically
spotLight.shadow.mapSize.copy(vector2);
```

</details>

##### Dynamic Attach

You can pass a dynamic value by using **Property Binding** syntax `[attach]`. When this is the case, `attach` accepts `Array<string | number>` in addition to just `string`. Common use-case for this is to attach different materials to different faces of a geometry.

```angular-ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh>
            <ngt-box-geometry />
            @for (color of colors; track $index) {
                <ngt-mesh-basic-material
                    [attach]="['material', $index]"
                    [color]="color"
                />
            }
        </ngt-mesh>
    `
})
export class MyCube {
  protected colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange', 'purple']; // cube has 6 faces
}
```

<details>
<summary>THREE.js equivalent</summary>

```angular-ts
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

mesh.geometry = geometry;
mesh.material = [];

const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange', 'purple'];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
    material.color.set(colors[i]);
    mesh.material[i] = material;
}
```

</details>

##### `NgtAttachFunction`

Last but not least, you can pass a `NgtAttachFunction` to `[attach]` property. When this is the case, you are responsible for attaching and detaching the element yourself.

`NgtAttachFunction` can be created using an identity function `createAttachFunction` to help with typings.

```angular-ts
import { createAttachFunction } from 'angular-three';

@Component({
  template: `
        <ngt-mesh>
            <ngt-mesh-basic-material [attach]="attachFn" />
        </ngt-mesh>
  `
})
export class SceneGraph {
    protected attachFn = createAttachFunction<THREE.MeshBasicMaterial, THREE.Mesh>(({ parent, child }) => {
        const oldMaterial = parent.material;
        parent.material = child;

        // return a clean-up function that will be called when `ngt-mesh-basic-material` is destroyed
        return () => {
            parent.material = oldMaterial;
        }
    })
}
```

## Event Bindings

As you've learned in [**Handling Events**](/learn/basics/handling-events), you can use [**Event Binding**](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/event-listeners) syntax to listen to various events on the elements. This section will go over some THREE.js native events and some specific Angular Three events that all objects share in addition to **Raycast Events**.

### THREE.js native events

Most THREE.js objects extends [`EventDispatcher`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/EventDispatcher) and can emit arbitrary events. There are some well-known events that Angular Three renderer supports via the **Event Binding** syntax.

- `added`: when the object is added to the parent
- `removed`: when the object is removed from the parent
- `childadded`: when a child is added to the object
- `childremoved`: when a child is removed from the object
- `change`: when the object's properties change. This is mostly applied to controls like `OrbitControls`
- `disposed`: when the object is disposed. The original event name is `dispose` but Angular Three uses `disposed` to not have conflict with `[dispose]` property

```angular-html
<ngt-group (childadded)="onChildAdded()">
    <ngt-mesh (added)="onAdded()"></ngt-mesh>
</ngt-group>
```

<details>
<summary>THREE.js equivalent</summary>

```angular-ts
const group = new THREE.Group();
group.addEventListener('childadded', onChildAdded);

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
mesh.addEventListener('added', onAdded);

group.add(mesh);
```

</details>

### Angular Three events

#### `attached`

This event is emitted when the element is **attached** or **added** to the parent. This is subtly different than the THREE.js `added` event because it also emits when a non-Object3D object (i.e: Material) is attached to the parent.

```angular-ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh>
            <ngt-mesh-basic-material (attached)="onAttached($event)" />
        </ngt-mesh>
    `
})
export class SceneGraph {
    onAttached(event: NgtAfterAttach<THREE.MeshBasicMaterial, THREE.Mesh>) {
        const { parent, node } = event;
        //       ^? Mesh ^? MeshBasicMaterial
    }
}
```

#### `updated`

This event is emitted when the element is **updated**, mostly via **Property Binding**

```angular-ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh
            [position]="[1, 1, 1]"
            (updated)="onUpdated($event)"
        ></ngt-mesh>
    `
})
export class SceneGraph {
    onUpdated(event: THREE.Mesh) { }
}
```
