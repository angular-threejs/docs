When you have a need to change some deeply nested property of a THREE.js object but you don't want to go through the whole [`viewChild`](https://angular.dev/api/core/ViewChild) to get the reference to the object to change that property, you can use `ngt-value` and take advantage of [`attaching`](./renderer)

## Usage

```angular-ts
@Component({
    template: `
        @if (gltf.value(); as gltf) {
            <ngt-mesh [geometry]="gltf.nodes.model.geometry" [material]="gltf.materials.material">
                <ngt-value rawValue="green" attach="material.color" />
            </ngt-mesh>
        }
    `
})
export class MyCmp {
    protected gltf = gltfResource(() => someGLTF);
}
```

In this example, you load a GLTF model and [reuse the geometry alongside the material](/learn/advanced/performance/reusing-resources). In order to change the color of the `material`, it is tricky without `ngt-value`. With `ngt-value`, you _declaratively_ tell the template that you want to update the `material.color` to `green`. You can also use property binding with `[rawValue]` to make it reactive too.
