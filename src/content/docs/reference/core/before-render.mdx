`beforeRender` is a [Custom Inject Function](https://nartc.me/blog/inject-function-the-right-way/) that allows you to execute logic before each frame render. This is useful for animations, updates, or any computations that need to happen on every frame.

## Usage

`beforeRender` requires a before render callback. This callback is invoked on every frame with `NgtRenderState`

```angular-ts
export interface NgtRenderState extends NgtState {
    delta: number;
    frame?: XRFrame;
}
```

Check out [`Store section`](./store) for details on `NgtState`.

```angular-ts
export class MyCmp {
    constructor() {
        beforeRender(({ camera, delta }) => {
            camera.position.x = Math.sin(Date.now() / 1000) * delta;
        });
    }
}
```

### Optional `injector`

Since `beforeRender` is a CIF, it has to be invoked in an [**Injection Context**](https://angular.dev/guide/di/dependency-injection-context). In order to invoke `beforeRender` outside of an **Injection Context**, you can provide an `Injector` to the `injector` property of the 2nd argument to `beforeRender`

```angular-ts
export class MyCmp {
    constructor() {
        const injector = inject(Injector);
        afterNextRender(() => {
            // outside of Injection Context, provide Injector âœ…
            beforeRender(() => {}, { injector })
        })
    }
}
```

### Optional `priority`

The `priority` parameter determines the order of execution when multiple before render callbacks are registered:

```angular-ts
// executes first
beforeRender(cb1, { priority: 1 });
// executes second
beforeRender(cb2, { priority: 2 });
```

`priority` can also be dynamic using a `Signal<number>`

```angular-ts
export class MyCmp {
    priority = input(0);

    constructor() {
        beforeRender(
            ({ camera, delta }) => {
                camera.position.x = Math.sin(Date.now() / 1000) * delta;
            },
            {
                priority: this.priority
            }
        );
    }
}
```

## How it works

`beforeRender` subscribes to the internal render loop of Angular Three.

When using a static `priority` number, it returns an unsubscribe function, but you typically don't need to use it as it's automatically handled by Angular's [`DestroyRef`](https://angular.dev/api/core/DestroyRef)

When using a dynamic `priority`, it sets up an internal [`effect`](https://angular.dev/api/core/Effect) and returns the `EffectRef#destroy` function. Again, cleanup is automatically handled through `DestroyRef`.

:::tip

Since the before render callback is invoked on every frame, you don't necessarily to use Signals in the callback body unless things are already Signals like Queries or Inputs.
