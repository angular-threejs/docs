description: angular-three NgtParent API

`NgtParent` is a [structural directive](https://angular.dev/guide/structural-directives) that allows you to attach a THREE.js object to an arbitrary parent that does not _necessarily_ have to be on the same template hierarchy.
This is most common when working with [**portals**](/learn/advanced/portals) where you cannot control attaching logic of `router-outlet`

## Usage

```angular-ts
import { NgtParent } from 'angular-three';

@Component({
    template: `
        @for (name of names; track name) {
            <ngt-mesh [name]="name" (click)="router.navigate([name])">
                <!-- ... -->
            </ngt-mesh>
        }

        <router-outlet />
    `,
    imports: [RouterOutlet]
})
export class MyCmp {
    names = ['a', 'b', 'c']
}

@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-group *parent="parent">
            <ngts-text [text]="parent()" />
        </ngt-group>
    `,
    imports: [NgtParent, NgtsText]
})
export class MyText {
    private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
    protected parent = toSignal(
        this.route.params.map(params => params.get('name')),
        { initialValue: '' }
    );
}
```

## How it works

`NgtParent` resolves the `parent` input to a `THREE.Object3D` and when it's ready to render its template, Angular Three will be able to access the provided `parent` (as a `THREE.Object3D`) and attach the template to that parent, effectively _portal_ that template to the provided parent.

`NgtParent` accepts:

- A `string`: which will be used to look up the object with `getObjectByName()`
- An `Object3D`
- An `ElementRef<Object3D>`
- or a `Signal` of all of these above

For the example above, when `NgtParent` resolves the `parent` Signal, it resolves via the `name` of the `THREE.Mesh` and will attach the `THREE.Group` as a child to that `THREE.Mesh`
