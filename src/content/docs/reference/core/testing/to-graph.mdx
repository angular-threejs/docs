`toGraph` is a function that allows you to convert a THREE.js object into a simple `NgtTestGraphObject`.

This is useful for snapshot testing as it at least provides the scene graph structure.

```angular-ts
const { fixture, toGraph } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
fixture.detectChanges();

expect(toGraph()).toMatchSnapshot();

/**
 * For a scene with a single mesh
 *
 * [
 *     {
 *         "type": "Mesh",
 *         "name": "",
 *         "children": []
 *     }
 * ]
 */
```
