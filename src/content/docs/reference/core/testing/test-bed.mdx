`NgtTestBed` is a utility from `angular-three/testing` that abstracts [`TestBed`](https://angular.dev/api/core/testing/TestBed) and provides a set of utilities to help you write unit tests for scene graphs built with Angular Three.

## `create()`

`NgtTestBed` exposes a single static method `create()` that accepts a `Component` class for the scene graph you want to test and returns an object with the following properties:

```angular-ts
const ngtTestBed = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
ngtTestBed.fixture; // ComponentFixture<NgtTestCanvas>
ngtTestBed.store; // SignalState<NgtState>
ngtTestBed.scene; // root THREE.Scene
ngtTestBed.sceneInstanceNode; // root Scene instance state
ngtTestBed.canvas; // the mocked HTMLCanvasElement
ngtTestBed.destroy; // method to destroy the fixture
ngtTestBed.fireEvent; // method to fire events on an element in the scene graph
ngtTestBed.advance; // method to advance the animation loop manually per frame
ngtTestBed.toGraph; // method to convert the scene graph to a simple object
```

### `mockCanvasOptions`

You can customize the mocked `HTMLCanvasElement` with `mockCanvasOptions`. It accepts `width` and `height` as well as a `beforeReturn` callback which allows you to return a mocked `HTMLCanvasElement` before the `TestBed` is created.

```angular-ts
NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph, {
    mockCanvasOptions: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
});
```

### `canvasConfiguration`

You can customize the [`ngt-canvas`](/reference/core/dom/canvas) via `canvasConfiguration`. It accepts everything that `ngt-canvas` accepts.

```angular-ts
NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph, {
    canvasConfiguration: {
        camera: { position: [0, 0, 5] },
        shadows: true,
    },
});
```

:::note

Options that alter THREE.js color management like `linear`, `flat`, and `legacy` can affect the assertions in the test for THREE.js objects that are affected by THREE.js color management (e.g: `THREE.Color`)

:::

## Example Scenario

For the example scenario, `scene`, `fireEvent`, and `advance` will allow you to test the `SceneGraph` component.

- `scene` allows you to assert the state of the scene graph
- `fireEvent` allows you to fire events on the cube
- `advance` allows you to advance the animation loop manually per frame

```angular-ts
import { NgtTestBed } from 'angular-three/testing';

describe('SceneGraph', () => {
    it('should render', async () => {
        const { scene, fireEvent, advance } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
    });
});
```

With `scene`, you can assert the state of the scene graph and you can do so however you want to. To keep things simple, you can try asserting that the root `THREE.Scene` has a child which is a `THREE.Mesh`

```angular-ts {8-10}
import { is } from 'angular-three';
import { NgtTestBed } from 'angular-three/testing';

describe('SceneGraph', () => {
    it('should render', async () => {
        const { scene, fireEvent, advance } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);

        expect(scene.children.length).toEqual(1);
        const mesh = scene.children[0];
        expect(is.three<THREE.Mesh>(mesh, 'isMesh')).toEqual(true);
    });
});
```
