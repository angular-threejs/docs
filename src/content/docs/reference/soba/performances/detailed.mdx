title: NgtsDetailed
description: angular-three-soba/performances NgtsDetailed introduction

An abstraction for [`THREE.LOD`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/LOD) that allows you to render a level of details hierarchy and automatically updates the camera in the animation loop.

```angular-ts
import { NgtsDetailed } from 'angular-three-soba/performances';
```

```angular-html
<ngts-detailed [distances]="[0, 50, 150]">
    <ngt-mesh [geometry]="highDetail" />
    <ngt-mesh [geometry]="mediumDetail" />
    <ngt-mesh [geometry]="lowDetail" />
</ngts-detailed>
```

`NgtsDetailed` accepts a required `distances` input which is an array of distances in world units. The distances should match the amount and the order of the children.
