`angular-three-soba/loaders` provides various loaders for files such as GLTF, FBX, textures, and fonts.

## Resource-based APIs (recommended)

These functions use Angular's resource API and are the recommended approach for loading assets:

- [gltfResource](./gltf-resource) - Load GLTF/GLB 3D models with Draco and Meshopt support
- [textureResource](./texture-resource) - Load texture images
- [fontResource](./font-resource) - Load font files for TextGeometry
- [fbxResource](./fbx-resource) - Load FBX 3D models

## Progress Tracking

- [progress](./progress) - Track Three.js asset loading progress
- [NgtsLoader](./loader) - Loading screen component while assets are being loaded

## Legacy APIs (deprecated)

> **Note**: These functions are deprecated and will be removed in v5.0.0. Use the resource-based APIs instead.

| Deprecated       | Replacement       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `injectGLTF`     | `gltfResource`    |
| `injectTexture`  | `textureResource` |
| `injectFont`     | `fontResource`    |
| `injectFBX`      | `fbxResource`     |
| `injectProgress` | `progress`        |
