The events system in Angular Three is inspired by [React Three Fiber (R3F)](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/api/events) but adapted to Angular's syntax and conventions. Below, we explore how to handle events, customize interactions, and leverage Angular-specific features.

## Document/Window Events

:::note

This section only applies to the browser platform.

:::

Custom components and directives within the `NgtCanvas` component are rendered to the Canvas but you can always attach events to the [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) or [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) objects via [`host`](https://angular.dev/guide/components/host-elements#) property.

```angular-ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { injectStore } from "angular-three";

@Component({
    host: {
        '(document:keydown)': 'onKeyDown($event)',
        '(window:scroll)': 'onScroll($event)'
    }
})
export class MyCmp {
    private store = injectStore(); // can still inject Angular Three context store

    onKeyDown(event: KeyboardEvent) {
        // able to handle events on the Document object
    }

    onScroll(event: Event) {
        // able to handle events on the Window object
    }
}
```

If you want to attach events to the `HTMLCanvasElement`, you can get access this element via the **store**

```angular-ts
@Component({})
export class MyCmp {
    private store = injectStore();
    private canvasElement = this.store.gl.domElement(); // Signal<HTMLCanvasElement>

    // or you can grab the snapshot if you're sure at this point, the Canvas is available
    // private canvasElement = this.store.snapshot.gl.domElement; // HTMLCanvasElement
}
```

## THREE.js Events

Angular Three supports native THREE.js events using Angular's event binding syntax. Check out [events reference page](/reference/core/renderer) for details.

## Raycast Events

THREE.js objects that implement their own raycast method (meshes, lines, etc.) can be interacted with using Angular's event binding syntax. Events contain both the browser event and THREE.js event data.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh
  (click)="handleClick($event)"
  (contextmenu)="handleContextMenu($event)"
  (dblclick)="handleDoubleClick($event)"
  (pointerup)="handlePointerUp($event)"
  (pointerdown)="handlePointerDown($event)"
  (pointerover)="handlePointerOver($event)"
  (pointerout)="handlePointerOut($event)"
  (pointermove)="handlePointerMove($event)"
  (wheel)="handleWheel($event)"
  (pointermissed)="handlePointerMissed($event)"
>
</ngt-mesh>
```

:::note

Additionally, there are two special events `(updated)` and `(attached)` that Angular Three has for all elements. [Events reference page](/reference/core/renderer) also mentions these two events.

:::

:::note

`pointerenter` and `pointerleave` events function identically to `pointerover` and `pointerout`. When `pointerout` occurs, the event may contain intersection data from the previous event with that object.

:::

### Event Data

Here are the interfaces that comprise `NgtThreeEvent` which is the interface for the data of these raycast events

```angular-ts
export interface NgtIntersection extends THREE.Intersection {
    /** The event source (the object which registered the handler) */
    eventObject: THREE.Object3D;
}

export interface NgtIntersectionEvent<TSourceEvent> extends NgtIntersection {
    /** The event source (the object which registered the handler) */
    eventObject: THREE.Object3D;
    /** An array of intersections */
    intersections: NgtIntersection[];
    /** vec3.set(pointer.x, pointer.y, 0).unproject(camera) */
    unprojectedPoint: THREE.Vector3;
    /** Normalized event coordinates */
    pointer: THREE.Vector2;
    /** Delta between first click and this event */
    delta: number;
    /** The ray that pierced it */
    ray: THREE.Ray;
    /** The camera that was used by the raycaster */
    camera: NgtCamera;
    /** stopPropagation will stop underlying handlers from firing */
    stopPropagation: () => void;
    /** The original host event */
    nativeEvent: TSourceEvent;
    /** If the event was stopped by calling stopPropagation */
    stopped: boolean;
}

export type NgtThreeEvent<TEvent> = NgtIntersectionEvent<TEvent> & NgtProperties<TEvent>;

export interface NgtEventHandlers {
    click?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<MouseEvent>) => void;
    contextmenu?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<MouseEvent>) => void;
    dblclick?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<MouseEvent>) => void;
    pointerup?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointerdown?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointerover?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointerout?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointerenter?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointerleave?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointermove?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    pointermissed?: (event: MouseEvent) => void;
    pointercancel?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) => void;
    wheel?: (event: NgtThreeEvent<WheelEvent>) => void;
}
```

### Opt-out of Raycast Events

Since objects with `raycast` method are subject to raycast events, you can opt any object out of raycast events by passing `null` for `[raycast]` input.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh [raycast]="null">
    <!-- ... -->
</ngt-mesh>
```

### Event Propagation (bubbling)

The event system handles propagation uniquely to accommodate 3D space and object occlusion:

1. When a ray intersects multiple objects, the system creates an ordered list of intersections based on distance from the camera
2. The event is first delivered to the nearest object
3. It then bubbles up through that object's ancestors (similar to DOM event bubbling)
4. After completing that path, it moves to the next nearest object
5. This process continues through all intersected objects

This means objects are naturally "transparent" to pointer events by default, even when they handle the event themselves.

#### `stopPropagation()`

To make an object "block" events from reaching objects behind it:

```angular-ts
export class MyCmp {
    handlePointerOver(event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        // Your event handling logic here
    }
}
```

`stopPropagation()` has two effects:

1. Stops the event from bubbling up to ancestors.
2. Prevents the event from reaching objects further along the ray. This means that if the "blocked" objects were previously delivered `pointerover` events, they will immediately be delivered `pointerout` events.

```angular-ts
// scene-graph.ts

import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, input } from "@angular/core";
import { NgtArgs } from "angular-three";
import { NgtsOrbitControls } from "angular-three-soba/controls";
import * as THREE from "three";

@Component({
    selector: "app-scene-graph",
    template: `
        <ngt-color *args="['#201919']" attach="background" />

        <ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="0.5" />
        <ngt-spot-light [position]="[0, 8, 4]" [intensity]="Math.PI" [decay]="0" [angle]="2" />

        <ngt-group>
            @for (x of positions; track $index) {
                @for (y of positions; track $index) {
                    @for (z of positions; track $index) {
                        <ngt-mesh
                            [position]="[x, y, z]"
                            (pointerenter)="
                                stopPropagation() && $event.stopPropagation();
                                $any(material).color.set('mediumpurple');
                            "
                            (pointerleave)="
                                stopPropagation() && $event.stopPropagation();
                                $any(material).color.set('#efefef');
                            "
                        >

                        </ngt-mesh>
                    }
                }
            }
        </ngt-group>

})
export class SceneGraph {
    protected readonly Math = Math;
    protected readonly positions = [-2.5, 0, 2.5];

    stopPropagation = input(true);
}

### Pointer Capturing

Angular Three supports pointer capture for maintaining interaction control:

```angular-ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh
            (pointerdown)="onPointerDown($event)"
            (pointerup)="onPointerUp($event)"
        >
            <!-- mesh contents -->
        </ngt-mesh>
    `
})
export class MeshComponent {
    onPointerDown(event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        // Capture ensures subsequent pointer events go to this object
        event.target.setPointerCapture(event.nativeEvent.pointerId);
    }

    onPointerUp(event: NgtThreeEvent<PointerEvent>) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        // Release the capture when interaction is complete
        event.target.releasePointerCapture(event.nativeEvent.pointerId);
    }
}
```

:::caution

Currently, the pointer capture system supports single-pointer interactions. For multi-touch scenarios, additional handling may be required.

:::

### Custom Event Configuration

For advanced use cases, you can customize the event system's behavior using the `events` input on `NgtCanvas` component. The `events` input accepts a function
that expects the **store** and returns a `NgtEventManager<EventTarget>` where `EventTarget` is the type of element that events will be attached to.

```angular-ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-canvas
            [events]="eventConfig"
        >
            <!-- scene contents -->
        </ngt-canvas>
    `
})
export class SceneComponent {
    eventConfig = (store: NgtStore): NgtEventManager<HTMLElement> => ({
        enabled: true,                 // Enable/disable event system
        priority: 1,                   // Event layer priority
        filter: (items: THREE.Intersection[], store: NgtStore) => items,  // Custom intersection filter
        compute: (event: PointerEvent, store: NgtStore) => {
            // Custom pointer/raycaster computation
            store.pointer.set(
                (event.offsetX / store.get('size').width) * 2 - 1,
                -(event.offsetY / store.get('size').height) * 2 + 1
            );
            store.raycaster.setFromCamera(store.pointer, store.get('camera'));
        }
    });
}
```

Here's the `NgtEventManager` interface

```angular-ts
export interface NgtEventManager<TTarget> {
    /** Determines if the event layer is active */
    enabled: boolean;
    /** Event layer priority, higher prioritized layers come first and may stop(-propagate) lower layer  */
    priority: number;
    /** The compute function needs to set up the raycaster and an xy- pointer  */
    compute?: NgtComputeFunction;
    /** The filter can re-order or re-structure the intersections  */
    filter?: NgtFilterFunction;
    /** The target node the event layer is tied to */
    connected?: TTarget;
    /** All the pointer event handlers through which the host forwards native events */
    handlers?: NgtEvents;
    /** Allows re-connecting to another target */
    connect?: (target: TTarget) => void;
    /** Removes all existing events handlers from the target */
    disconnect?: () => void;
    /** Triggers a onPointerMove with the last known event. This can be useful to enable raycasting without
    *  explicit user interaction, for instance when the camera moves a hoverable object underneath the cursor.
    */
    update?: () => void;
}
```

### Forcing Raycast Updates

By default, raycasting only occurs during user interactions. To force a raycast update (e.g., when camera or objects move under a static cursor), you can call `update()` from the `NgtEventManager` in the **store**. More common use-case is to force raycast update in the before render loop to react to Camera movements.

```angular-ts
export class MyCmp {
    constructor() {
        injectBeforeRender(({ events }) => {
            // Trigger a raycast with the last known pointer position
            events.update?.();
        })
    }
}
```
